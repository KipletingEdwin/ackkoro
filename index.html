        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <h4>We are a congregation of the Church of the Anglican Church of Kenya in the Diocese of Eldoret</h4>
    </div>
    <div id="history">
        <div class="hist">
            <p>The A.C.K is a member of the worldwide Anglican Communion. St. Mark’s 
                is a parish church and its congregation comes from all over Nairobi and 
                beyond. The St. Mark’s Church was built in 1907 on a site near Parklands.
                 During the 1950s the present larger building in Westlands was planned
                  and opened in 1958. The site of the old church was dismantled in 1970. 
                  Some of the pews and stained glass windows were however transferred 
                  to the new church.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ory">
            <p>After the church came to the present site a church hall was built. The hall
                 was in need of expansion to cater for the growth of the church. St. Mark’s
                  has also helped in the establishment of the NYARI PARISH as well as the 
                  Nursery School. About twelve years ago St. Mary’s Church Kabete and St. 
                  Joseph’s Church Kabete were made a separate parish which has continued 
                  to grow in strength.</p>
